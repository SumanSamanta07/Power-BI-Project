Based on the analysis of the provided dashboards, here are some actionable recommendations:

 1. Improve Overall Satisfaction
- North Counties and South Counties: These areas show relatively low overall satisfaction levels. Focus on understanding the specific issues in these regions through surveys or feedback sessions and address them directly.
- High Satisfaction in South London: Leverage best practices from South London, where satisfaction is high, and implement them in other regions.

 2. Enhance Contact Ease
- Fairly Difficult Contact: A significant portion of respondents found it fairly difficult to contact the centre. Simplify contact methods, improve the responsiveness of communication channels, and ensure that information about how to contact the centre is clear and accessible.

 3. Increase Kindness and Professionalism of Contact Centre Team
- Training Programs: Despite a high number of very satisfied ratings, there are still notable counts in lower satisfaction categories. Regular training programs focused on customer service skills, empathy, and professionalism can help boost these numbers.

 4. Speed Up Query Resolution
- Focus on Speed: North Counties show a significant portion of fairly satisfied ratings with the speed of query resolution. Prioritize reducing resolution times by streamlining processes, investing in efficient CRM systems, and increasing staffing levels if necessary.

 5. Address Confidentiality Concerns
- Confidentiality Policies: A noticeable fraction of respondents have privacy concerns. Reassure customers by clearly communicating confidentiality policies and ensuring robust data protection measures are in place.

 6. Monitor and Maintain Monthly Satisfaction Trends
- Consistent Monitoring: There are fluctuations in monthly satisfaction. Implement a consistent monitoring system to quickly identify and address emerging issues. Regular feedback collection and prompt action based on insights can help maintain a steady satisfaction trend.

 7. Cater to Renters and Homeowners
- Targeted Communication: With a significant majority of respondents being homeowners, tailor services and communication to meet the specific needs of this group. However, do not neglect renters; ensure their concerns are also addressed adequately.

 8. Improve Service in Specific Local Authorities
- Local Authority Focus: Authorities like Westminster, Tower Hamlets, and Wandsworth have high satisfaction ratings. Study these areas to understand what is being done right. Conversely, focus on improving services in authorities with lower ratings such as Vale of White Horse and Wokingham.

 9. Resolve Income Queries Efficiently
- Income Queries: The most common reason for contact is income queries. Streamline and prioritize responses to these queries, possibly by creating specialized teams or resources dedicated to handling them quickly and effectively.

 10. Recognize and Reward Top Operatives
- Employee Recognition: Acknowledge the top operatives by satisfaction level, such as Operative 1, who has a significantly higher count of satisfied customers. Recognize and reward these employees to boost morale and motivate others.

 11. Encourage Date Resolution Documentation
- Documentation Improvement: Ensure that resolution dates are documented accurately and comprehensively. Encourage staff to follow this practice to better track performance and identify areas for improvement.

 12. Analyze and Act on Reason for Contact
- Deep Dive into Contact Reasons: Conduct a deeper analysis into less frequent contact reasons, such as tenancy changes and insurance queries, to identify if there are underlying issues that can be proactively addressed.

Implementing these recommendations can help enhance overall customer satisfaction, improve service efficiency, and ensure a higher level of professionalism and responsiveness in the contact centre.
